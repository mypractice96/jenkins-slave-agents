# jenkins-slave-agents

When we need scalable jenkins, then we use to run the jobs in the dynamically provisioned containers.

Using Docker cloud plugins, we can connect to the slave containers in the following ways.


* Method 1 : Attach Docker Container  
* Method 2 : JNLP (can be used for both docker cloud as well as Kubernetes)
* Method 3 : SSH
